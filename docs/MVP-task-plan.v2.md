# MVP Task Plan - Snapshot

> Full roadmap now lives in `docs/MVP-task-plan.md`.  
> This file records concise highlights from the latest restructuring.

## Highlights
- Dashboard member, group, and task views now consume Supabase detail views, restoring Chinese copy and enriching org context.
- Organization bootstrap flow is idempotent: creators always become org owners and default group admins.
- Manual validation checklist refreshed to cover Sprint 2 usage paths end to end.
- Tagging system and mobile task experience planning folded into the main plan to avoid duplicate documents.

Refer to `MVP-task-plan.md` for complete backlog, validation steps, and upcoming milestones.
